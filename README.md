# Active Directory Security Lab

This repository documents a small, intentionally scoped Active Directory lab built to understand how Active Directory works and how it behaves from a security perspective.

The lab is based on a standard Active Directory walkthrough and is extended with a small number of security-focused observations to explore:

- Normal authentication and directory behavior
- How authorization misconfigurations introduce risk
- Where default Active Directory visibility is limited

The goal of this project is to support learning relevant to SOC and junior security engineering roles by connecting Active Directory fundamentals with practical security concepts.
