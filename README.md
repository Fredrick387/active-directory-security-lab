# Active Directory Security Lab

This repository documents a small, intentionally scoped Active Directory lab built to understand AD as a security system rather than an infrastructure exercise.

The lab is based on a standard Active Directory walkthrough and extended with minimal, security-focused observations to explore:

- Normal authentication and directory behavior
- How authorization misconfigurations introduce risk
- Where default Active Directory visibility is limited

This project is designed to support learning relevant to SOC and junior security engineering roles.
